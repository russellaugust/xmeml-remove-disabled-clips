# Premiere XML Disabled Clip Remover
Premiere has no way of automatically removing disabled clips so this is a round-trip XML workflow to get rid of them.
Currently, it does the *opposite.* It removes everything but the disabled clips.  This way, you can paste the disabled clips back over your hero sequence and then delete.  It's a little hacky for now and hopefully I can find a way to migrate this over to Extendscript to keep it all simple. But for now, this is what it is.
